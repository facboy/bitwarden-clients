import { Meta, Primary, Controls, Canvas, Title, Description } from "@storybook/addon-docs";

import * as stories from "./base-card.stories";

<Meta of={stories} />

```ts
import { BaseCardComponent } from "@bitwarden/components";
```

<Title />
<Description />

<Canvas of={stories.Default} />

## BaseCardDirective

There is also a `BaseCardDirective` available for use as a hostDirective if need be. But, most
likely using `<bit-base-card>` in your template will do.

```ts
import { BaseCardDirective } from "@bitwarden/components";
```
